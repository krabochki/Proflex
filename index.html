Some of the largest countries in the world are English-speaking. Among them the <abbr title="The United States of America">USA</abbr>, Canada, Australia and Great Britain.</p>
          <p>English has become an international language due to its significance in many areas, such as industry, business, finance, agriculture, and else.</p> 
          <p>It’s the accepted language of modern digital era. A lot of problems of the 21st century, such as the problems of war and peace, ecology, can not be solved without speaking the same language.</p>
