					<h1>Programmers</h1> </div>
				<div class="p-main">
					<p> A programmer is a specialist who writes and tests code for software. A more general term is a computer scientist, but still the term "programmer" can be used
						to refer to a software developer, software engineer, computer specialist, software analyst, etc. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="1">
					<h2 id="HeightH2">
            What programmers do </h2>
					<p> The responsibilities of a programmer usually include: developing software and applications using various computer languages ​​(such as C++, Java, Python etc.),
						creating and improving operating systems (iOS, Android, Windows, Linux), developing websites, updating and expanding existing software, checking programs for
						bugs and fixing corrupt lines of computer code, creating and testing code in an integrated development environment (IDE), maintenance, network architecture.
						</p>
					<p>When looking for a job, you can find vacancies by languages ​​that programmers work with (C++ programmer, Java programmer PHP programmer), by type of task (web-programmer,
						front-end / back-end developer), and by the level of experience/position (intern, junior, medium, senior). </p>
				</div>
				<div class="2">
					<h2>Advantages of the profession</h2>
					<ul class="justol">
						<li> <strong>Creative space and tangible results</strong>
							<br>The ability to write code opens an endless field of possibilities. Programmers create applications and programs and automate various tasks. They simplify
							and speed up processes for users, solve almost any problem, and subsequently make life easier for people. The programmer can create something of their own,
							thereby helping others. </li>
						<li> <strong>	Remote work</strong>
							<br>Since a programmer only needs a computer to work, such specialists are usually not tied to a specific location. The Internet connects it with other users
							and the cloud storage databases. It should be noted, however, that remote work does not suit all workers and employers. </li>
						<li> <strong>Continuous development</strong>
							<br> Technology is changing rapidly. IT also does not stand still, for example, new programming languages ​​appear. For IT professionals, there is a large selection
							of courses and programs dedicated to specific topics and innovations or advanced training. However, there is a downside to this. Programmers are forced to
							learn something new every day and keep up with the times, otherwise, there is a risk of becoming a non-demanded specialist with outdated knowledge. </li>
						<li> <strong>High salaries</strong>
							<br> Programmers are in demand in many countries, and therefore their work is highly paid. For example, the salary for the entry-level position in the USA can
							be as high as 5,875 USD/month. </li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="3">
					<h2>
  					Disadvantages of the profession

</h2>
					<ul class="justol">
						<li> <strong>Impact on health</strong>
							<br> All day programmers work indoors in front of the computer. For hours in a row, they knock on their keyboard, click mouse buttons, and stare at the screen.
							Such motionless work can lead to muscle and bone pains, eye strain, and subsequently to other chronic diseases. An ergonomic chair, wrist cushions, and regular
							exercise throughout the day can help mitigate some of the negative health side effects, but offsetting all the risks associated with sedentary work is difficult.
							</li>
						<li> <strong>Exhausting work</strong>
							<br> Programmers are constantly engaged in mental work, and in their free time, they are forced to learn new things. Also, IT specialists often crunch a lot.
							A software engineer Edward Yourdon even came up with the concept of ‘Death March’. The term refers to a project that is too complex, doomed to failure, or
							requiring the doubling of work hours to complete it. For example, a 40-hour week becomes an 80-hour week. Such workloads can last for weeks or even months,
							which cannot but affect the personal life, the physical and mental health of the programmer. </li>
						<li> <strong>High competition</strong>
							<br> With all the advantages of a job, namely high salaries and demand, many are striving to get it. What makes the competition even more fierce is the remote
							work format and globalized world. Programmers from developing countries work just as well, sometimes even better than local specialists, and their work is
							often cheaper, which attracts many employers. </li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="4">
					<h2>Specializations</h2>
					<p> There are a lot of specializations in IT. When choosing a direction follow your interests, since each specialization has its own characteristics. For example,
						if you like applied design, then robotics is suitable for studying, but if you fancy computational problems, then fundamental informatics is your choice. Popular
						areas in universities are Computer Science and Software Engineering. Computer science is a general and diverse field of study that has various branches (artificial
						intelligence, computer systems and networks, security). Also, such specialization as Data Science is gaining momentum. It implies work with statistics and
						mathematics. </p>
					<p> Among the promising areas for the future are computer security and artificial intelligence: </p>
					<ul class="justol">
						<li><strong>Cybersecurity</strong>
							<br> With the introduction of technology in all spheres of human life: from buying groceries to managing the state, more and more hackers and cyber terrorists
							appear. They harm both individuals and government agencies and large companies. Therefore, in the modern world, data protection is not a luxury, but a vital
							necessity. To defend against cyberattacks and security breaches, leading organizations are willing to pay big sums to cyber analysts. The U.S. Bureau of Labor
							Statistics predicts that cybersecurity jobs will grow 28% from 2016 to 2026 — much faster when compared to the average growth of the other professions. </li>
						<li> <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>
							<br>It is one of the most controversial and intriguing areas in computer science. AI is still in its early stages of development, but tech giants like Google
							and IBM are already investing huge amounts of money and resources into AI research. The global robotics industry is expected to be worth 80 billion USD by
							2024. The field of study is promising and could completely change the world. However, artificial intelligence has both benefits and potential risks. Apart
							from the doomsday scenario, AI, for example, can optimize tasks and reduce human error, but at the same time lead to the automatization of labor, and therefore
							to the disappearance of jobs.</li>
					</ul>

				<div class="5">
					<h2>How to become a programmer?</h2>
					<p> You don’t necessarily need an education to become a programmer, especially when you consider the fact that the IT sphere is developing at the speed of light
						and traditional universities and colleges struggle to keep up with the innovations of science. </p>
					<p> However, experienced specialists still insist on obtaining higher or at least secondary vocational education. It will take much more time and effort to master
						the IT field on your own than in a university that already has a developed curriculum, a training system, incentives in the form of grades and mentors who
						know their subject. If, after all, your choice is a self-study, then you need to be patient and persistent. </p>
					<p> It is important to read professional literature, attend courses, and practice a lot. However, one should not hope for high engineering and research positions
						— they require higher education. After school or college, it is quite possible to start from the position of a simple developer, keep learning, and subsequently
						become a good specialist. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="6">
					<h2>
                  What qualities does a programmer need?

</h2>
					<p>Programming is suitable for people who enjoy finding solutions to problems. This is probably the key element of IT. Here, a specialist needs a share of creativity,
						an extraordinary mind, and a desire to constantly learn. Patience and perseverance in the face of difficulties, when the code does not work or you need to
						find a small bug, will not hurt. Future programmers should also have good analytical skills and developed logic.</p>
					<p>At school, those wishing to become an IT specialist should pay attention to computer science, logic, mathematics, physics, and English. However, this is not
						set in stone, because, for example, knowledge of mathematics is not required for simple problems. However, for full growth and success in the profession you
						will need mathematics as it can direct the thinking to the right track.</p>
					<p> This profession is characterized by a high concentration on one problem at a time and long-term mental activity, therefore restlessness and absent-mindedness
						can become an obstacle in becoming a good programmer. In addition to technical skills that will be taught in universities and colleges, an IT specialist additionally
						will need soft skills like quick reading and understanding of written instructions, problem identification, independence, curiosity, critical thinking, listening
						skills (for teamwork), and attention to detail. </p>
					<p> Tip: start coding and practice as early as possible in order to understand whether this profession is right for you or not. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="7">
					<h2>
                  Where do programmers work?

</h2>
					<p> Programmers can work in any industry that uses applications, software, sites, and the Internet. Many seek to get into large tech companies, for example, Google,
						Apple, Samsung, Yandex, Amazon, Microsoft. </p>
					<p> Most IT professionals work in a traditional office. However, their work can often be done remotely, which is why some employers allow their programmers to work
						from home. </p>
					<p> There is a possibility that in the future quantum computers will replace the current — binary ones. If binary computers operate with bits, then quantum ones
						operate with qubits. They are much more powerful and more complex than those familiar to the average PC. The capabilities of a quantum computer could open
						up entirely new areas of study and work. However, such computers are still at an early stage of development and do not have well-established programming languages[4].
						</p>
					<p> In many developing countries, programmers tend to go to work abroad. This is largely due to low salaries, a stagnant corporate culture, and limited free space,
						namely, the unwillingness to create something new and adherence to familiar techniques. Programming is a promising and growing industry in which the field
						for discovery and innovation is endless. However, not all companies create favorable and comfortable conditions for employees, as a result of which they not
						only lose talented personnel and stop improving their product but also impede the development of the industry in the country as a whole. </p>
