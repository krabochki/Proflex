					<h1>A long way to computers</h1> </div>
				<div class="p-main">
					<p> The history of computers, despite the fact that it is relatively short, can surprise with its richness. Let's get acquainted
						with it. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="1">
					<h2 id="HeightH2">
          A very long way        </h2>
					<h3>First calculating devices</h3>
					<p> The very first calculating device was the ten fingers of a man’s hands. This, in fact, is why today we still count in
						tens and multiples of tens. </p>
					<p> Then the abacus was invented, a bead frame in which the beads are moved from left to right. People went on using some
						form of abacus well into the 16th century, and it is still being used in some parts of the world because it can be
						understood without knowing how to read. During the 17th and 18th century people tried to find easy way of calculating.
						</p>
					<h3>  Real calculating devices</h3>
					<p> The first real calculating machine appeared in 1820 as the result of several people’s experiments. This type of machine,
						which saves a great deal of time and reduces the possibility of making mistakes, depends on a series of ten-toothed
						gear wheels. </p>
					<p> In 1830 Charles Babbage, an Englishman, designed a machine that was called “The Analytical Engine”. </p>
					<p> This machine, which Babbage showed at the Paris Exhibition in 1855, was an attempt to cut out the human being altogether,
						except for providing the machine with the necessary facts about the problem to be solved. </p>
					<p> He never finished this work, but many of his ideas were the basis for building today’s computers. In 1930, the first
						analog computer was built by an American named Vannevar Bush. This device was used in World War II to help aim guns.
						</p>
					<p> “Mark I”, the name given to the first digital computer, was completed in 1944. </p>
					<p> The men responsible for this invention were Professor Howard Alken and some people from IBM*. </p>
					<div class="notecard"><strong>Note:</strong> International Business Machines, a leading US computer manufacturer.</div>
					<p> This was the first machine that could figure out long lists of mathematical problems all at a very fast rate. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="2">
					<h2>
          Generations of computers
        </h2>
					<p> In 1946 two engineers at the University of Pennsylvania, J. Eckert and J. Maushly, built the first digital computer
						using parts called vacuum tubes. They named their new invention ENIAC. </p>
					<h3>The first generation of computers</h3>
					<p> Another important advancement in computers came in 1947, when John von Newmann developed the idea of keeping instructions
						for the computer inside the computer’s memory. The first generation of com- puters, which used vacuum tubes, came out
						in 1950. UNIVAC I is an example of these computers, which could perform thousands of calculations per second. </p>
					<h3>The second generation of computers</h3>
					<p> In 1960, the second generation of computers was developed and these could perform work ten times faster than their predecessors.
						The reason for this extra speed was the use of transistors instead of vacuum tubes. </p>
					<p> Second-generation computers were smaller, faster and more depen- dable than first-generation computers.</p>
					<h3>The third generation of computers</h3>
					<p> Third-generation computers appeared on the market in 1965. These computers could do a million calculations per second,
						which is 1000 times as many as first-generation computers. </p>
					<p> Unlike second-generation computers, these are controlled by tiny in- tegrated circuits and are consequently smaller
						and more dependable. </p>
					<h3>The fourth generation of computers</h3>
					<p> Fourth-generation computers have now arrived, and the integrated circuits that are being developed have been greatly
						reduced in size. </p>
					<p> This is due to microminiaturization, which means that the circuits are much smaller than before; as many as 1000 tiny
						circuits now fit onto a single chip. </p>
					<p> A chip is a square or rectangular piece of silicon, usually from 1/10 to 1/4 inch, upon which several layers of an integrated
						circuits are etched or imprinted, after which the circuit is encapsulated in plastic or metal. </p>
					<p> Fourth-generation computers are 50 times faster than third-generation computers and can complete approximately 1,000,000
						instructions per second. </p>

					<h2>
            Generations of microcomputers
          </h2>
					<p>
						<h3> The first generation of microcomputers</h3>
						<p> First microcomputers were a weird bunch. They often came in kits, and many were essentially just boxes with lights
							and switches, usable only to engineers and hobbyists whom could understand binary code. Some, however, did come with
							a keyboard and/or a monitor, bearing somewhat more resemblance to modern computers. </p>
						<p> It is arguable which of the early microcomputers could be called a first. CTC Datapoint 2200 is one candidate, although
							it actually didn’t contain a microprocessor (being based on a multi-chip CPU design instead), and wasn’t meant to
							be a standalone computer, but merely a terminal for the mainframes. The reason some might consider it a first microcomputer
							is because it could be used as a de-facto standalone computer, it was small enough, and its multi-chip CPU architecture
							actually became a basis for the x86 architecture later used in IBM PC and its descendants. Plus, it even came with
							a keyboard and a monitor, an exception in those days. </p>
						<p> However, if we are looking for the first microcomputer that came with a proper microprocessor, was meant to be a standalone
							computer, and didn’t come as a kit then it would be Micral N, which used Intel 8008 microprocessor. </p>
						<p> Popular early microcomputers which did come in kits include MOS Technology KIM-1, Altair 8800, and Apple I. Altair
							8800 in particular spawned a large following among the hobbyists, and is considered the spark that started the microcomputer
							revolution, as these hobbyists went on to found companies centered around personal computing, such as Microsoft, and
							Apple. </p>
						<h3> The second generation of microcomputers</h3>
						<p> As microcomputers continued to evolve they became easier to operate, making them accessible to a larger audience. They
							typically came with a keyboard and a monitor, or could be easily connected to a TV, and they supported visual representation
							of text and numbers on the screen. </p>
						<p> In other words, lights and switches were replaced by screens and keyboards, and the necessity to understand binary
							code was diminished as they increasingly came with programs that could be used by issuing more easily understandable
							commands. Famous early examples of such computers include Commodore PET, Apple II, and in the 80s the IBM PC. </p>
						<p> The nature of the underlying electronic components didn’t change between these computers and modern computers we know
							of today, but what did change was the number of circuits that could be put onto a single microchip. Intel’s co-founder
							Gordon Moore predicted the doubling of the number of transistor on a single chip every two years, which became known
							as “Moore’s Law”, and this trend has roughly held for over 30 years thanks to advancing manufacturing processes and
							microprocessor designs. </p>
						<p> The consequence was a predictable exponential increase in processing power that could be put into a smaller package,
							which had a direct effect on the possible form factors as well as applications of modern computers, which is what
							most of the forthcoming paradigm shifting innovations in computing were about. </p>
