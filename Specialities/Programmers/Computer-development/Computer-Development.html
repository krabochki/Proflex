					<h1>Computer development</h1> </div>
				<div class="p-main">
					<p> An amazing machine! We are living in the computer age today and most of our day to day activities cannot be accomplished without using computers. Sometimes knowingly and sometimes unknowingly we use computers. Computer has become an indispensable and multipurpose tool. We are breathing in the computer age and gradually computer has become such a desire necessity of life that it is difficult to imagine life without it. </p>

         Definition
        </h2>
					<p> For most of the people, computer is a machine used for a calculation or a computation, but actually it is much more than that. PreciselyComputer is an electronic device for performing arithmetic and logical operation. Or "Computer is a device or a flexible machine to process data and converts it into information." To know about the complete process that how computer works, we will have to come across the various terms such as Data, Processing and Information. First of all we will have to understand these terms in true sense. </p>
					<ol class="justol">
						<li> <strong>Data</strong>
							<br> It is nothing but a mare collection of basic facts and figure without any sequence. When the data is collected as facts and figure, it has no meaning at that time, for example, name of student, names of employees etc. </li>
						<li><strong>Processing</strong>
							<br> Processing is the set of instruction given by the user or the related data to output the meaningful information. Which can be used by the user? The work of processing may be the calculation, comparisons or the decision taken by the computer.</li>
						<li> <strong> Information </strong>
							<br>Information is the end point or the final output of any processed work. When the output data is meaning it is called information. </li>
					</ol>

					<h2>Rapid development</h2> Technology has never been as prevalent in daily life as it is today, with the trend of the increasing significance of technology only set to continue. It is therefore of use to look back at how technology has evolved, both from a technical perspective and how technology is consumed. In a matter of 60 years, computer technology has gone from requiring an entire room to operate, to the desk, to the pocket and now running largely from the Cloud. This drastic growth in technical capabilities has led to an equally drastic change in how computer technology is consumed. The original general-purpose computers largely acted as a mathematical calculator. Today, relatively strong computational power can be found in everything from our smartphones, to our watches and fridges. </div>
				<div class="3">
					<h2>
            Why is this happening?        </h2> Nothing epitomizes modern life better than the computer. For better or worse, computers have infiltrated every aspect of our society. Today computers do much more than simply compute: supermarket scanners calculate our grocery bill while keeping store inventory; computerized telphone switching centers play traffic cop to millions of calls and keep lines of communication untangled; and automatic teller machines (ATM) let us conduct banking transactions from virtually anywhere in the world. But where did all this technology come from and where is it heading? To fully understand and appreciate the impact computers have on our lives and promises they hold for the future, it is important to understand their evolution. </div>
