				<h2>Programmers</h2>
				<h3> Who is a programmer? </h3>
				<p> Programmers develop algorithms and computer programs. All over the world, programmers are in great demand, their work is well paid. Team leads and technicians (highly qualified specialists) receive more. You can become a programmer at any age. The profession is suitable both for men and women with good analytical skills, logic, knowledge of mathematics (in some areas of development) and necessarily English. Not only practical skills but also ideas are valued in programming. You can learn the profession in universities, courses and colleges, but you can also learn it on your own. Some employers prefer programmers with higher technical education.
				<h3> Specializations of programmers </h3>
				<p>Developers can be divided into two major categories depending on their specialization.</p>
				<ol>
					<li> 
						<strong>Application programmers</strong>
						<p>They develop application software - games, accounting programs, editors, messengers, etc. Their fields of work include creation of software for ERP and CRM systems like 1C, video and audio surveillance systems, fire-fighting or fire-alarm systems, etc. They also adapt existing programs to the needs of a specific organization or user.</p>
						<p> Here is the list of some application specializations of programmers: </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Web programmer;</li>
							<li>1C programmer;</li>
							<li>Android developer;</li>
							<li>Game developer (GameDev);</li>
							<li>System programmers</li>
						</ul>
						<p> They develop operating systems, robots, work with networks, write interfaces to various distributed databases. They write code for hardware. Systems programmers are among the rarest and highest paid professions. Their task is to develop software systems (services), which control computer systems (which includes the processor, communication and peripheral devices). They also support the operation of the systems they create (device drivers‚ bootloaders, etc.). </p>
					</li>
					<li> 
						<strong>Programming languages developers</strong>
						<p> Developers have very different tasks, and not all programming languages are equally suitable for these tasks. Here is a list of the most popular programming languages. </p>
					</li>
				</ol> 
				<img class="Images" src="Pictures/programmer.png" alt="This is Mr. Bull's friend in the role of a programmer" title='The Bulldog — is a British breed of dog of mastiff type. It may also be known as the English Bulldog or British Bulldog. It is of medium size, a muscular, hefty dog with a wrinkled face and a distinctive pushed-in nose. It is commonly kept as a companion dog; in 2013 it was in twelfth place on a list of the breeds most frequently registered worldwide. The Bulldog has a longstanding association with British culture; the BBC wrote: "to many the Bulldog is a national icon, symbolising pluck and determination". During the Second World War, the Prime Minister Winston Churchill was likened to a Bulldog for his defiance of Nazi Germany. The Bulldog Club (In England) was formed in 1878, and the Bulldog Club of America was formed in 1890.'/>

				<h2>Architects</h2>
				<p> North American children know about Hiroshima. They are taught about the dangers of nuclear war. Sometimes they learn the details of the damage that was done. They learn about what happened at 8:15 am on August 6, 1945. People were eating breakfast; children were going to school and adults going to work. There was a blinding flash of light, a scorching heat, and a mushroom cloud rose up. People close to the explosion were instantly vaporized. Many of those further away would die from burns and radiation. Sixty thousand houses were destroyed immediately. One concrete structure remained standing, although it was damaged. The local government left the Atomic Dome standing as a memorial to the explosion. </p> 			
				<img class="Images" src="Pictures/architect.png" alt="This is Mr. Bull's friend in the role of a architect" title="The Pekingese (in Chinese: 北京狗) — is a sacred breed of dog of the Chinese emperors, bred in ancient China more than 2000 years ago. It is one of the oldest dog breeds.The very name of the breed comes from the city of Beijing. The Chinese call Pekingese dogs Fu. Only members of the Chinese emperor's family could have Pekingese. They were kept in the palace and were not accessible to ordinary residents. It was believed that these were small guards, and outwardly Pekingese look more like tiny lions than dogs. There is an ancient Chinese legend about the origin of the Pekingese: according to this legend, the lion king of beasts in immemorial times fell in love with a monkey and took her to wife; the cub born from this marriage inherited the funny appearance of the mother and the proud character of the father."/>

				<h2>Mechanics</h2>
				<p> Fall fairs have been a feature of North American life since early in the nineteenth century. At the end of the harvest, people from rural areas have come together to celebrate. Usually, these fairs take the form of a competition regarding the best of all farm products of that year. Depending on the part of the country, and its most important crop, fall fairs can begin as early as August or as late as November. They usually last several days. When the United States and Canada were organized, they were divided into small units called counties. Larger units were called states or provinces. Many of the best-known fairs are county fairs or state fairs. There are also smaller local fairs, and larger ones too, like the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, Ontario. Since these fairs are usually annual events, many have developed permanent buildings over the years. </p> 
				<img class="Images" src="Pictures/mechanic.png" alt="This is Mr. Bull's friend in the role of a mechanic" title="The Dalmatian, or Dalmatian dog — is a breed of dog bred in Croatia. The name of the breed was given by the historical region of Dalmatia on the Balkan Peninsula. Dogs with spots in color and very similar to modern Dalmatians were known in ancient times, for example, archaeological excavations in Greece allowed us to see a variety of paintings in which, along with people, dogs very similar to modern Dalmatians were depicted. And this means that Dalmatians have been around for several millennia. Dalmatians are quite active dogs that require heavy loads and long walks in the fresh air."/>

They learn about what happened at 8:15 am on August 6, 1945. People were eating breakfast; children were going to school and adults going to work. There was a blinding flash of light, a scorching heat, and a mushroom cloud rose up. American leaders feared that they might lose many men by an invasion. Dropping the atomic bomb would end the war very quickly. President Truman made the decision to use it. </p> <img class='Images' src="Pictures/builder.png" alt="This is Mr. Bull's friend in the role of a builder" title="Petit-Brabanson, or small Brabanson, or Brabant Griffon, or smooth-haired Griffon — is a breed of decorative dogs bred in Belgium. Refers to small Belgian dogs. Probably a relative of the pug. Affectionate and inquisitive, Brabant griffons are strongly attached to their owners."/>

The breed has a fine, glossy coat that comes in a variety of colors, most often light brown (fawn) or black, and a compact, square body with well developed and thick muscles all over the body. Pugs were brought from China to Europe in the sixteenth century and were popularized in Western Europe by the House of Orange of the Netherlands, and the House of Stuart. In the United Kingdom, in the nineteenth century, Queen Victoria developed a passion for pugs which she passed on to other members of the Royal Family."/>
